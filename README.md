English-to-German Translation Module with Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Integration
# Instructions
I'd like you to please follow the attached image of the flowchart to understand the question. 
Make a language translation module (English to German) using a transformer model with multi-hued self-attention. 
Avoid using the transformer library. Follow the dataset,  details, and parameter information from the "attention is all you need" paper. 
For speech-to-text use the Deepgram library. for text to speech use any library that you feel works for you.
